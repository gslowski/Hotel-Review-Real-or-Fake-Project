"After considering several hotels in the area, my family and I finally decided, unfortunately, on Homewood Suites, for our long weekend vacation. Overall, the experience left much to be desired. The breakfast buffet consisted of cold scrambled eggs and greasy pastries. The linens on one of our beds seemed dirty, and when I told the hotel staff and asked them to be replaced, the woman rolled her eyes and had a very unprofessional attitude. I would not come back here ever.",negative,fake,real
"Ambassador East is an awesome hotel!!! Understand that this hotel is full of history and is a boutique hotel. My family stayed at the Ambassador for two nights in a suite. Very clean room with great space. The best part of the Ambassador is not the rooms though. The staff was extremely courteous, especially the concierge. If you stay here you have to go to the Pump Room. The restaurant is full of nostalgia, the staff is great, and the food is excellent. Great atmosphere and music. ",positive,real,fake
"As I walked into the hotel I was greeted warm heartedly. They took my information from me in an efficient manner and got me to my room quickly. I was very pleased to see that my bed was laid out perfectly and that there was plenty of towels in the bathroom. Also, I was happy to see that the shampoo and soap provided was sufficient. Overall, I was very happy with my stay at this hotel. ",positive,fake,real
Best hotel in an excellent location I stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower with my husband and kid as he came there for a Business purpose. My 1 year old kid was jumping on the bed and he really enjoyed the atmosphere of the room. The front desk people were too welcoming and the staffs were very friendly . The room service was also good. The room was very clean and the bathrooms are so good . I like the decor of the room. The French restaurant in Sofitel is so good and we both enjoyed the dining . I will surely prefer to stay in Sofitel on a next time travel to Chicago.,positive,fake,real
"Everything you would would expect from a top-notch hotel and exceeded by the service. The trendy decor and easy to access dining gave us a 'second-wind' pick up after a day of sight-seeing. This hotel is definitely the place that I want to come back to. By the time we left after 4 days and 3 nights, my wife and I wished we had more time to enjoy the restaurant a few more times and the delightful Swiss flare. One of the things we enjoyed the most was seeing the water from our window. The feeling of being pampered can only come from the very gracious hotel staff and this hotel is number 1 in my mind.

"For the amount of money per night that the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel charges, one would at least expect a room with a working bathroom. The toilet wouldn't flush, the sink dripped and the towels were rough and cheap looking. When I called the front desk to ask for maintenance on the sink and toilet, the staff were indifferent. It was over an hour before anyone arrived to fix the bathroom fixtures, and when they did arrive they were unable to stop the drip in the sink. All in all, I was disappointed with my stay.",negative,fake,real

"Hi, I had very bad experience with this hotel, as the rooms had bad smell and very dim light. the bed sheets were not properly cleaned. Also the carpet was dirty though AC was working properly. But i would nor recommend this hotel to my friends as it did not satisfied me. There was a problem with hot and cold water in the bathroom. Please do not go to this hotel, it seems very nice from the pictures and all but in actual its different.",negative,fake,real
"Hotel Monaco is simply amazing. I travel quite a bit, and am use to generic hotels, with horribly unimpressive rooms, and ""5 star amenities"" which usually mean a packet of instant coffee, and room service that won't serve after 9pm. Hotel Monaco on the other hand was very impressive. The suite i stayed in was stylish and cozy. This hotel has such personality. My absolute favorite part of my stay, aside from the amazing meal i had down stairs, was the in-room spa treatment. Hotel Monaco just raised the bar on hotels for me. Generic just won't do anymore.",positive,fake,real
"I accompanied my husband on a business trip to Chicago back in September and we stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel. The place was absolutely oozing with old-fashioned charm! Also, there were plenty of shopping opportunities within walking distance, so I shopped while my husband worked. It just doesn't get any better than that! I loved the service we received and the ambiance of that grand old hotel, and I'd definitely stay there again!",positive,fake,real
"I found this hotel in the ""Small Luxury Hotels of the World"" booklet having stayed in many of these in recent years, and they were indeed above and beyond average hotels. I therefore chose it for a 4 night stay while visiting from England. The Talbott was excellently located, although i had a view of a building site, and did have an ambience and some charm, however it was a little dirty and faded around the edges and the service was appalling. I had to wait in the foyer well after check in time, having previously attempted to check in earlier, tired and in need of a rest, while a ""final check"" was done to my room. The valet parking was not outside when requested, breakfast was not included in the price, all the things requested of reception did not occur, and there were very few touches which make a hotel stay special. I have stayed in hotels which are so much more elegant, where the staff and service are first rate for half the price of this hotel. I was severely disappointed and cannot recommend it at all.",negative,real,fake
"I had the misfortune of being booked at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago a few weeks ago. What a joke. To start off, the housekeeping staff must be on strike or they are very understaffed. I don't know who made the bed up in my room, but it could have been done better by my 7 year old. Ditto the bathroom. Water spots, soap scum and (ugh) hair of ALL kinds in the sink, tub and about the floor. GROSS. I requested non-smoking, either they didn't listen or didn't care, but my room and the linens smelled like an old ashtray. The ""beautiful view"" was ruined by water spots - not outside(which is forgiveable) but INSIDE! And they were sticky. I stayed only one night. The Holiday Inn had rooms available, and they were clean. Never Again.",negative,fake,real
"I haven't actually stayed at this hotel- yet- but am already disappointed in their customer service. I visit Chicago quite often and usually stay at the InterContinental, but yesterday I read some online articles advertising The James Hotel's ""Cyber Monday Special"". The promo states that if you buy a gift certificate from their website, the hotel will match that amount in ""James Credits"" that can be used toward your stay. None of the articles gave an expiration date for these credits. My next trip to Chicago is in April, so I thought I'd give The James a try. I travel frequently with my pet and I've heard they have a very liberal pet-policy. So today I went online and bought a $500 certificate. Me, having the one track mind that I do, somehow missed the part about the credits expiring March 31, 2010. I realized my mistake immediately and called the hotel front desk to explain my predicament. I said I couldn't be in Chicago until April (I'm overseas on business until then), and asked if they could extend my credits an extra month, or it not, refund my gift certificate purchase. I had only just made the purchase minutes before and hadn't even recieved my email confirmation yet. Most businesses offer a 24 hr grace period. The girl at the front dest was extremely rude to me- basically saying ""too bad, it's your problem now"". She didn't even bother to act polite or pretend to be sympathetic about my situation at all. So now that I know this is the kind of service I can expect from The James, I might just call it a wash and stay at my usual hotel, or try Hotel Monaco. I hear they have great service and are good with pets too.",negative,real,fake
"I recently stayed at the Affina Chicago hotel and was really dissappointed. When I arrived, the desk clerk was really slow checking me in. I feel like turtles could have checked me in faster. I was finally checked in and my room was on the 8th floor. The elevator ride seemed to take forever. I arrived and the room and at first glance it looked great, but after looking everything over there were finger smudges on the glass table. I figured maybe room cleanin must have accidentally touched it. I went to the C-House for supper that evening and I had to wait for what seemed like forever. The meal was good, but my waitress was very uptight. On my way back to my room, I asked the front desk to set up a wake up call for 6 AM the next morning and they were very grateful to set that up. It would have been nice to actually get it though. The next morning I surprisingly work up at 7:18 AM and realized that I had not received a wake up call. I was very upset and let them know. Overall this experience was not worth the 4 stars that this hotel has been given. For the price, quality and ratings the Affina Chicago hotel has been given, I would expect better service.",negative,fake,real
I recently stayed here for the Chicago triathlon. This was my third stay at this hotel. I have not had any issues until this visit. After the 3rd day of my stay I requested my room to be serviced and returned to what I thought was a clean room. While getting out of bed I was cut by a piece of glass in the carpet. I must not have been the first person to be cut in the room because I found dried blood on the bathroom floor afterwards. I had not noticed it before so I was very disgusted. We notified the staff and asked that the room be vacuumed and the bathroom mopped. We returned to the room after 5pm to find that the dried blood was still on the floor. After making a complaint to the customer service I have gotten no reply from the hotel. Considering the price point of this downtown hotel I would think that they would try to live up the 5 star rating but instead they have failed miserably. Luckily there are many hotels to choose from in downtown Chicago.,negative,real,fake
"I travel a lot for business and quite frankly, my expectations were starting to reach new lows. I usually always choose W Hotels just for the consistency (of average hotels). The Affinia in Chicago has raised my expectations and W Hotels are going to suffer in comparison. This hotel is one of the cleanest I have stayed at in some time. Service was impeccable. Friendly front-desk staff and the extra towels I ordered arrived literally within minutes. The gym has new equipment with plenty of space. And such a fun vibe - without dark hallways and loud music. I have to thank the other reviewers - their reviews led me to the Affinia and I was so pleased. My new ""Chicago Hotel"". It will even lead me to try the Manhattan hotels. ",positive,real,fake
"I was going to Chicago last month and wanted a nice hotel that was close to restaurants and shops. I did some research and believed the InterContinental would suit my needs. I sure was not disappointed by my decision! This hotel lots of historic charm. Despite being a larger hotel, the service was top shelf! The rooms, while not large by any means, were extremely well-appointed and very comfortable. My kids loved the big swimming pool that the hotel offered. As for me, I was more impressed with the location to the Magnificent Mile. The hotel also has a nice restaurant on-site. The food was very good and, just like the hotel itself, the restaurant provided perfect customer service. Dollar for dollar, the InterContinental in Chicago is a great deal and I will be staying there again. ",positive,fake,real
"I was looking forward to staying here for my wedding in late September, and was surprised by the signs of hard times that were subtle, but affected me and my husband. For example, he got locked out of our room 2 times, once having to wait for 15 minutes in the hallway after going to the spa. The other time was when he was getting ready for our wedding ceremony, so that was stressful because he lost some time. The keycard just would stop working. Then a fuse blew, so we had no power while trying to get ready. It happened to me also, coming back from the spa, and I called on the hallway phone to get help. Luckily, right after that, an employee who was randomly walking by asked me if I had been waiting long--as if she knew this was a problem. I said no, and she called down to check. Apparently, no one had even called Security to get me back into my room! She had a set of keys and let me in, thank god. Then, on our wedding night, my husband wanted to order from room service. It was a little after 10:30pm. We were told that room service was closed for the night--even though all the literature in the room brags about ""24 hour dining."" That fact was never communicated to us when we checked in. I feel like the quality of service and amenities are slipping. We later heard something about a lot of employees getting laid off, so maybe that's why people weren't too intersted in providing good service. I don't think if I would recommend that anyone stay at this Fairmont nor will I ever again. BTW, the spa is great to hang out in, even if you're not doing a massage.",negative,real,fake
"I was really expecting a lot more from a quality chain like the Sheraton, but a recent stay at their downtown location in Chicago was somewhat of a disappointment. It started with check in; I had specifically requested a room with a single king-size bed, but was told at the front desk in no uncertain terms (OK, rather rudely!) that because of some banker's convention that was going on, I should be happy with the double-bed room that was left. It was all I could do to get a lousy drink voucher for my inconvenience! The room itself was OK, nothing special though. The cleaning staff must've just been through, because there was a faint aroma of old washrags still in the air. The internet jack wasn't working. It took more than two hours for a maintenance guy to come up to fix it, no apologies given. For the price, I really expected more in the way of customer service from Sheraton. I guess they're really no better than anyone else these days!",negative,fake,real
"I went here with the family, including our dog Marley(They are very pet friendly). We really enjoyed it. This place is huge with over 480 rooms and suites and is in the center of downtown close to shopping and entertainment. It also seems that it would be a great place to have a wedding or to host an event. I will definately be coming back next time I need to come to chicago definately a fine four star hotel!",positive,fake,real
"I work for a software marketing firm, and that job requires me to travel at least 100 days per year. I spend a large amount of time in hotels. I normally don't write reviews for hotels, but the Homewood Suites by Hilton were above and beyond. Let's start where it matters: the rooms. They are top notch. There's nothing better than walking in to a clean, beautiful rooms after a long day of travel. The beds are among the best I've ever slept in in hotels. The rest of the room is just as nice and makes me feel at home. The price: Low. I looked for similar rooms in the area at other hotels, and everything else was at least 10% more expensive. But you don't get what you pay for here. You get much more than that! The location: Couldn't be better. You want to go to a world class restaurant? That's within walking distance. You want a great shopping experience? Again, walking distance. Anything else you want? Chances are, it's within walking distance. Overall, one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in.",positive,fake,real
"If you're looking for luxuary, look no more. The Conrad is the best. I was in Chicago on business, and had to stay much longer than anticipated. A coworker suggested this hotel and boy am I glad he did. The location is perfect, you're close to everything. The best part is the Conrad is a smoke free hotel. I'll be back soon.

"Me and my wife stayed at the Omni hotel in Chicago for a customer training at a nearby hospital. We ended up only staying for 2 nights and the service was awful here. At first once coming into the room, there was a mildewy smell in the air, which we were fortunate enough to bring a potpourri spray with us just incase. The continental breakfast each morning was terrible as well. The eggs were runny and the coffee was not hot at all. To make matters even worse, the room service attendant did not get to our rooms until the middle of the afternoon, when my wife was back from exploring the city. This was simply unacceptable by any standard.",negative,fake,real
"My Family and I went to this hotel on holiday last month. It was a very bad hotel. When we got there we imediatly checked in and went up to our room. The view from the window was a brick wall. Really? We even asked the Lasy at the front desk, but she said they couldn't put us in a room with a view cause we didn't book one and we couldn't upgrade. Also, My Wife is a light sleeper and the trains kept her up at night. Another thing is alot of ads boast a hot tub in all the rooms but this is not true, our room only had a normal tub. But, the tub had no stopper, so we could only take showers. The room was also very small compared to other hotels with around the same prices.",negative,fake,real

"My husband and I wanted to spend the weekend in Chicago to celebrate our anniversary, and I had been looking at the James for awhile because it was attached to David Burke's Primehouse. From the moment I called to make my reservation, I knew this hotel understood what customer service means to a consumer and a picky one at that. From the pre-arrival dossier, to the special sweets from the staff to kick off our anniversary weekend and a hand written note thanking us for staying at the James, this staff is well versed in the long lost art of customer service. The rooms were well appointed and the beds comfy and warm on a cool weekend. The walking distance to Michigan Av is a huge plus. From the front desk to the cleaning staff, the staff here is top notch! And David Burke's Primehouse is not to be missed! ",positive,real,fake
"My stay at the Sofitel was great. I loved the location it was in. From the moment I arrived the experince was great, the attendants were helpful and the front desk was too.

Checkout was a breeze and I couldnt ask for anything more in a hotel stay. ",positive,fake,real
"My wife and I stayed at the Abassador East Hotel in August to attend the Air and Water Show in Chicago. I called ahead to ensure a SW view that would allow us to watch the airshow from our room if the weather did not permit us to watch from one of the nearby beaches. Upon arrival at the hotel, not only was our room on the west side of the hotel it wasn't even a single king as was requested. Apparently the hotel had overbooked king rooms for the event weekend and we were downgraded to a queen room. The room itself was small and underwhelming. The was not dirty, but the linens and furnishings all had a very old and worn feel. The hotel was packed the weekend we visited. The staff was obviously not prepared to cater to such a large crowd. The concierge and reception desks were continuously busy. The hotel restaurant was very slow and had long waits. The main lobby and other common areas throughout the hotel were also undergoing renovations making getting around and fighting crowds of other people even more difficult! Luckly the weather was nice and the airshow was enjoyable. We will not be staying at the Abassador on future trips. Hopefully, current renovations will provide a much needed lift to the hotels current worn down vibe...",negative,fake,real

"Our vacation was highlighted by a four day stay at Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown.I believed it would be the best part of the trip; I discovered it was an unfolding nightmare. While in our lovely room on the fifteenth floor, a voice emanating from the phone, informed us of the pending fire alarm and what procedures to follow. Anyone above the tenth floor was instructed to go into the bathroom, wet towels and place them along the bottom of the closed door.Do not use the elevators and wait for further instructions.We nervously waited for twenty minutes without any further communications from the voice in the phone.We then decided to exit via the stairs, realizing too late that once you entered the stairwells, doors behind you were locked.We continued to travel downward, against the backdrop music of sirens and loud muffled speakers.Obviously, we were rescued without any physical injuries; yet emotionally we were damaged.I now choose my hotels in the range of ten floors or less.",negative,fake,real
"Overpriced is the best word to describe the Conrad Chicago hotel. While it may be in downtown Chicago, the room had no view. Although I asked for non-smoking, the room reeked of smoke. The elevators were very slow, and one was not working during my stay. There was a stain on the pillow, and the leg of one of the chairs in the room was broken. There was a dead bug in the bath tub. I was only given 2 towels for my 4 night stay. My credit card was billed twice, and it took 2 weeks to reverse to extra charge. I do not recommend this hotel at all!",negative,fake,real
"Problems started when I booked the InterContinental Chicago online at the hotel's site, and got a server error. Somehow I managed to get my reservation, and wish I had looked elsewhere on this great Chicago street, filled with plenty of other options. The server errors continued at check in and didn't let up. I was on a holiday weekend, but far too many others must have been pushy conventioneers, and I had trouble getting served. The hotel is enormous and doesn't give a sense of comfort. The health facilities are also just too big, so noisy and crowded. And Internet access was $18 a day, kind of surprising when I can go around the corner to a Starbucks! Next time, I'll pick a more intimate place nearby--without so many ""server errors"".",negative,fake,real
"The International Chicago Magnificent Mile is shrouded in glamour, but underneath the facade fades away. The ""classical architectural landmark"" should be translated to ""old and boring. I found this hotel via Google and have regretted it ever since. Room size was small and unaccommodating, and that was one of the newer rooms! Everything was free except for the gym (why that wouldn't be free with the price I paid I don't know). This hotel is overpriced for the quality and size of the room that you get, and I would not recommend staying there.",negative,fake,real
"The Palmer House Hilton is an incredible break from the real world. The lobby is a throwback to the grand era of travel, and you can just imagine people stepping off the train with their steamer trunks. The lobby is luxe and gilded, with soaring ceilings and is staffed with friendly, accommodating employees. The rooms are plush, with each bed furnished with a Serenity Dreams topper for extra comfort. The room decor is modern and sleek, a world from the tacky furnishings in most hotels. For your convenience, there's a fully-stocked business center, pool, fitness room and workout area - something to accommodate the solo, business or family traveller. ",positive,fake,real
"The location was good. Check-in was ok. Asked for non smoking room, given floor with half smoking half non smoking. We could smell the smoke as soon as the elevator doors opened. We asked for and recieved a room on a non-smoking floor. They did not bring up the key, we had to go down to the lobby to get it. Breakfast could have had some healthy choices, the sweet rolls and danish were not fresh. Bananas not ripe. Room only had ONE wash cloth, had to call down for more. Housekeeping NEVER showed up at our room. Not for turndown service , not for the morning clean -up. Called down upon our arrival back to our room after being gone all day and we were accused of putting our the Do Not Disturb sign. They said they would come up and they never came when they said they would. We finally told them not to come because of the time. We wanted to get ready to go out for dinner. Never greeted by anyone as we came and went. I have stayed at the Peninsula and the Burnham. The Burnham was booked during our stay or I would have stayed there.I will NEVER stay at this hotel again, Not worth 300.00 a night",negative,real,fake
"The rates at The Talbott Hotel were cheaper than I had expected, and that was my reason for booking a room. I had been prepared for service and a room similar to what I had experienced in the past, and I was quite pleased when I did stay. The room was neat and clean, and the halls were quiet at night. The traffic noise was muffled to the point where it was no problem sleeping either. I did ask one question at the service desk and they answered it nicely, which is good because normally hotel workers can be a bit snippy, especially at night. Overall I had no problems with The Talbott Hotel and I would stay at this here again if I were in the area a second time.",positive,fake,real

They have a wide selection of packages that can include anything from the couple that wants to get away or a family outing.

Whether if it's a King Delux Room or a Tranquility Suite, all of the rooms are luxorious and are themed based, so it suits ones personality. Even if you are a super sized person, like me with a height of 6""4', there are special ""Tall Rooms"" just for you. My days went very fast when I stayed there becuase there was so much to do there. In the mornings I would do yoga from the Yoga Channel. Then I would go downstairs and drink one of their complimentary coffees while reading the morning newspaper. Before I go to a meeting, I would get my shoes shined by their complimentary shoeshine service. After I come back from the meeting, I would go to their fitness rooms and workout on their fully-equipped machines. I just didn't want to leave that hotel; so I decided that the next time I come to Chicago, I will surely stay at Hotel Monaco Chicago.",positive,fake,real

We loved our stay at the Talbott. We were in Chicago to attend the theater show Dirty Dancing. We booked our room through Orbitz and received a nice discount. When we arrived at the hotel everyone from the doorman to the front desk to the maids were highly professional and courtesy. We were upgraded to a King bed suite.

"We stayed at the Schicago Hilton for 4 days and 3 nights for a conference. I have to say, normally I am very easy going about amenities, cleanliness, and the like...however our experience at the Hilton was so awful I am taking the time to actually write this review. Truly, DO NOT stay at this hotel. When we arrived in our room, it was clear that the carpet hadn't been vacuumed. I figuered, ""okay, it's just the carpet."" Until I saw the bathroom! Although the bathroom had all the superficial indicators of housekeeping having recently cleaned (i.e., a paper band across the toilet, paper caps on the drinking glasses, etc., it was clear that no ACTUAL cleaning took place. There was a spot (probably urine!) on the toilet seat and, I kid you not, the remnants of a lip-smudge on the glass. I know people who have worked many years in the hotel industry and they always warned that lazy housekeeping will make things ""appear"" clean but in fact they make no effort to keep things sanitary. Well, the Hilton was proof. I called downstairs and complained, and they sent up a chambermaid hours later. Frankly, I found the room disgusting. The hotel itself, outside the rooms, was cavernous and unwelcoming, with an awful echo in the lobby area that created a migraine-inducing din. Rarely have I been so eager to leave a place as this. When I got home, I washed all my clothes whether I had worn them or not, such was the skeeviness of our accomodations. Please, do yourself a favor and stay at a CLEAN hotel.",negative,fake,real

"We will not be back to this hotel. There are several reasons for this, but it began at check-in when the staff were very rude and uptight. Our reservation was lost in the system and they seemed to think it was a strain on their time to have to find it. The room was OK, but the beds were hard and uncomfortable. The room next door had their TV turned up very loudly, and when we called to ask if we could change rooms were were told that was not an option. They didn't offer any other solutions. The food in the restaurants was extremely overpriced and not cooked to our requests. Overall, we wish that we had chosen a different hotel for our stay in Chicago.",negative,fake,real
"When making my reservation, I made it for one of the most busiest weekends during the summer Memorial Day. The staff was able to get my family in at an affordable rate. The suites are very spacious, clean, cozy, and comfortable. Upon on arriving staff were friendly, willing to exceed expectations, and serve me with enthusiasm. The Hot Breakfast was delicious each morning. The beds are very comfortable and provided a good nights rest. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and anyone who need additional space when traveling and on a budget compared to other Chicago hotels. ",positive,real,fake
While traveling in Chicago I stayed at the Sofitel on Chestnut Street. Though the hotel was a beautiful and comfortable as the advertisements suggest; service was severely lacking. I arrived late at night and had one peaceful dreamy nights sleep before being woke up at dawn. I reserved a room on one of the lower floors unaware of the construction happening in the area. I complained that I had not been informed of the construction and requested another room. My complaint was totally disregarded. I was told there were no other rooms in the whole hotel available. When I explained that the noise was bothersome I was treated rudely. The woman at the front desk actually ask me if I thought she could make the workers stop. I understand that the staff has no control over the noise. They did however know about the construction. Information I did not have at the time I booked. Information that would have swayed my decision. Then to treat me so rudely for bringing it to their attention. I will not be staying there again.,negative,fake,real

"Been here twice now and both times our experience was great. Suites are spacious and modern. Kitchens are well equipped. Service is friendly from front desk to the porters. Perfectly located close to almost all amenities you can imagine across the road plus there's a hospital a block away in case of emergencies. The free hot breakfast is surprisingly good and has more than your standard boiled eggs and oatmeal. There was scrambled eggs, 2 types of sausages, waffle maker, cereals, bagels and English muffins just to list a few. We will definitely be back the next time we stay in Calgary.",positive,fake,real
Do not call to make a reservation. You may get roped into a timeshare scam—shame on Hilton for Promoting this. Google Hilton Grand Vacations. Hilton Calgary Promoted this to me upon my booking. Daniel at the front desk is unprofessional and rude.,negative,real,fake
"Extremely disappointing experience! My husband and I booked a night getaway including couple's spa massage at their Spa downstairs. It was a cold snowy day and the heat in our room stopped working around 10 PM. We called the front desk to rectify the situation and they sent someone to check it, however, couldn't be fixed right away. Instead, they brought us  a SPACE HEATER!!!!! I have never stayed at a hotel where i had to heat up my room with a space heater. This is not the standards I hold Fairmont to. They should have moved us to another room with working heat. I called in the morning to speak with a manager and she gave us $90 discount on our room, what a disappointment. It should have been free for having to sleep in a freezing cold room. To top it off, early morning there…",negative,real,fake

"For just a night, it was a wonderful Sheraton experience and was well worth the stay.  My wife was quite impressed with the booking process and that all her requests were  satisfactorily accommodated by the hotel staff.  During the check-in, they were always a step ahead and seem to forecast our needs as a family.  Everyone is genuinely friendly and helpful.  I personally liked the layout of the room we got, not to mention a good view of the urban landscape outside. The breakfast experience was superb at the Wolf and Flower Restaurant.

"My husband and I recently stayed at The Courtyard Marriott and I wanted to share our experience:For our wedding day, my husband would be “tying the knot” in Okotoks on a big acreage, surrounded by friends and family. After the festivities of the big day, we would need a nice hotel to retreat to, and enjoy the rest of the night together.The hotel needed to be located close the wedding venue, but more importantly, it needed to be able to deliver a very special and remarkable experience for my husband and I. So I did some research online and made some phone calls.I called Courtyard Marriott and chatted with their reservation agent for quite some time. Of course mentioned our wedding and that the stay would in celebration of our first night as together as Mr. & Mrs.The agent was excited for us and seemed very nice. She assured me that we would have a very pleasant stay and that they would make every effort to make our marriage-night-stay a remarkable one.We weren't expecting them to roll out the red carpet, but it's nice when a hotel can go above and beyond and deliver that extra special experience for its guests.After a beautiful wedding surrounded by loved ones, and a night filled with singing and dancing, we were exhausted. We were also excited to get to the hotel and finally be alone together. My husband and I left the wedding celebrations just before the clock struck 12. We arrived at Courtyard Marriott still fully decked out in tuxedo and wedding gown. We were greeted by the customer service agent who asked for our ID and credit card. We quickly realized that in our haste to leave and with all the excitement of the day, the bag with the ID and credit cards in it had been forgotten in the room where I changed into my gown. The clerk told us she would not be able to check us into our room until we could present the credit card and ID. Clearly a bit of a problem.My husband and I had just drove 45 min from the wedding venue to the hotel. To drive back would take another two hours round-trip, so the last thing we wanted to do was head back to retrieve the cards.Rather than getting upset, we tried suggesting some easy solutions. Knowing I was a tired bride, my husband asked the clerk if I could just go up to the room and relax while he sorted everything out. He thought maybe he could have pictures of the ID and credit cards texted to us so she could verify the information, and then he would arrange to have the cards delivered shortly thereafter.This would allow us to continue enjoying our special day and still have everything sorted out before long. The clerk told him that nothing could be done without the cards.My husband had around $400 on him, so he asked if he could secure the room with a cash deposit. Plus the hotel already had all my CC information on file because I had provided it already when I initially booked the room. She never even addressed the cash deposit and told him she was unable use the card already on file without the actual CC there; not even temporarily.Although the clerk was never outright rude to us, she treated us like strangers who had just stumbled in off the streets. It's not as though we were intoxicated and being unreasonable, I enjoyed a glass or two of champagne and my husband doesn’t drink.It was becoming clear to us that either the clerk was unable or unwilling to extend any type hospitality towards us, nor offer any helpful suggestions. What could have been just a minor ""hiccup"" was quickly turning into a wedding disaster.Nearly in tears at this point, I started calling people still enjoying the wedding party while my husband continued to discuss possible solutions with the clerk.* He asked if he could pay cash for the deposit,*He asked if if I could go up to the room, get out of my gown and relax while they figure things out.*He asked if we could check in, make a few phone calls and have everything she needed, delivered within an hour. Still we were told nothing could be done until we provided her the credit cards and ID.After the 45 minutes of talking in circles with the lobby clerk, my husband again suggested he could pay cash and, for whatever reason, she finally agreed.Stunned by how complicated and unpleasant the check-in experience had been, we went up to the room. We opened the door to a new and clean hotel room. Nothing extra, again no effort by Marriott to show that they're in the hospitality industry to impress their guests and make their brand a clear choice when considering accommodations.When we woke up in the morning there was a note under the door asking us to join them for complimentary breakfast...no thanks. To say we we were disappointed would be a huge understatement, more like appalled.We still don’t know why it took over an hour for us to check-in that night.Perhaps the lady working was alone and had no management support to help her figure things out. One would think that any manager on-sight that night couldn't possibly be unaware of the situation unfolding at their check-in counter. It would be hard to miss a frantic groom and upset bride, still in their wedding clothes, trying to check-in at 1am. We were at the check-in desk for nearly an hour.Maybe she was overwhelmed by the situation and unsure if she was allowed to authorize that sort of an exception. Surely she could have reached out for support from her team and explained the situation to an experienced leader at another location, who could then authorized her to check us in.We realize that the oversight was completely our fault, but ultimately an easy fix. I'm not sure the extent of training Marriott employees receive, or how they select their employees, but clearly their management needs to make some big improvements to what practices are currently in place.A little advice to The Marriott management team: Having staff that are well trained, able to offer solutions when ""life happens,"" and then have the empowerment to implement said solutions should be the standard of a world class hotel chain. It is not impossible to keep the interests of your guests aligned with those of your business. In fact, this should be at the heart and soul of any business in the hospitality industry. After our stay at your hotel, we immediately left for our European honeymoon. I wish we could share the countless unforgettable memories we experienced from employees in the hospitality industry during our travels.Upon hearing it was our honeymoon, British Airway Stewards upgraded us to 1st class and treated us like Royalty; they even gave us a bottle of champagne to say “congrats” while we were disembarking the aircraft.During a romantic dinner in Portugal, the chef personally came to out from the kitchen to congratulate us and present us with special appetizer, “complements of the chef.”Nearly everywhere we went, when we mentioned it was our honeymoon, employees of businesses that really cared, went above and beyond to make us feel special.The difference between the way they conduct their business to that of Courtyard Marriott was in pride shown in their work, and their commitment to making their customers feel welcome and special.These are the kinds of places we never forget and that we love bringing our friends and family to, so they can experience it for themselves.I’m sad to say our wedding night stay at Courtyard Marriott will never be forgotten, but unfortunately unforgettable for all the wrong reasons.",negative,real,fake

The room and amenities provided by this hotel are far beyond our expectations providing us a value that we just did not expect.

"We had our second anniversary at the Hyatt. Anniversary was great, the hotel was terrible.- There was blood on the blanket when we arrived - I had purchased a food discount. The server at Thomson’s had us wait after settling our bill to ensure the discount was applied. After receiving the invoice a day later, the discount was not applied. - Parking is an extra $32. I did not see this disclaimer anywhere when purchasing the room. - The main reason we chose the Hyatt was so we could relax in the pool and hot tub. Both were filled with kids from 4:00pm until 10. We waited for hours to use the facilities, however they were filled to max capacity all night. That was our first and last time using the Hyatt. I highly recommend not staying there if you’re looking for a date night.",negative,real,fake
We stayed at the Fairmont Palliser for an anniversary getaway and were blown away!  We've stayed here before but this time was over the top.  We had a penthouse suite which was huge and beautiful.

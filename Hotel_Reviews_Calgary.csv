1,Le Germain,"Our 'getaway' hotel in our own city. Since its opening, my wife and I have stayed at Le Germain whenever we want to escape without escaping the city. The decor, amenities, location to amazing dining, and the hotel staff themselves will always bring us back!",positive,real
2,Le Germain,"We have stayed at Le Germain over the years when we are in Calgary and the experience has always been wonderful. Great to just drop off the car for valet parking and be able to wander downtown . Everyone we encountered was so friendly and made our stay so effortless .Rooms are really well equipped , beds so comfy and breakfast was yummy !",positive,real
3,Le Germain,"I loved this hotel! I asked to have a hypoallergenic room and that is exactly what I got. Most hotels don't bother, even when they are high priced. In my opinion that alone sets this one apart from all others. The room was lovely, comfortable and felt like home. I slept well. The price was fair. The staff were pleasant. Check-in and check-out were quick and easy. I have nothing but the best things to say about this hotel and I will stay here next time I come to Calgary.",positive,real
4,Le Germain,I had given it 3 stars because of leaking faucets...but now switching to 5 because of the unforgettable experience I had. The ambience and luxury is incomparable to most experiences I've had so far. Reasonable prices. Impeccable rooms. This hotel is on my list next time I decide to visit Calgary.,positive,real
5,Le Germain,"Awesome rooms, extremely helpful staff, and a great location. My stay was excellent and my team meeting ran extremely well. All COVID protocols were in place and we were accommodated in every way we hoped we could be. I would definitely stay at Le Germain Calgary for future trips.",positive,real
6,Le Germain,"By far one of the best hotels to stay in Calgary. The hotel has a chic and modern flair, something a little different from the typical ‘Cowtown vibe’. The rooms are aesthetically pleasing, comfortable beds, modern art pieces, and the hotel lounge is a nice upscale treat if you need to unwind during your stay. The staff have always provided me with impeccable service and room service was great. It’s also in a convenient location.",positive,fake

Can’t go wrong with this place.",positive,real
12,Le Germain,"ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! Check in was a breeze. The front desk staff were kind and knowledgeable. The bar associate made our experience unforgettable.

14,Le Germain,This was my first Le Germain experience and I was anticipating my visit as I finalized my move to BC. Bit of a rough start on Friday night with some very loud guests partying at 3 AM (sadly stayed over Stampede). Calls to the front desk to address the issue which they eventually got a handle on after the 3rd call. Rooms were clean and I Iiked the design aesthetic. Would definitely stay again and highly recommend. Shout out to Gor for the warm welcome!,positive,real
15,Le Germain,"This hotel is absolutely beautiful and located infront of the Calgary tower, which is located downtown. Room had unique electronic/technology features. The rooms shower & amenities were amazing. We had free complimentary wine & espresso coffee. We had a mini fridge filled with beverages, a drawer filled with snacks (chips, chocolates, nuts, etc. at a cost).We received room service from charcut roast house restaurant and the food tasted great. We received fast valet service parking, which within 5 minutes of a call to front desk they would bring out the car for you right away. The front desk was friendly and helpful, also helped with our luggages. I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel while your in Calgary, it’s definitely worth it.",positive,fake
16,Le Germain,Was such a gorgeous and fancy hotel room. The staff were lovely and it was such a wonderful stay. If I had to choose a hotel in Calgary again I would pick this place. It was also cool to look out the window and see the Calgary Tower tower right above you.,positive,real

26,Le Germain,"My husband and I were there on Sep 17, 2021 for 2 nights in a room the classic king. The weather of the room was too cold so I called to reception, more than 3 times someone came to my room for changed whether to hot but he couldn't at the last he brought heater for us. When I turned on the heater, it had loud noise and after a few minutes All electrical appliances in the room were turned off and when I turned off the heater, the weather was too cold. The other things about parking , I had to park in level 3 then I was walking in parking to level 4 for took a elevator, the parking was circle and when the other cars moved up the parking lot they couldn't see us and this is so dangerous. We had so problems in this hotel .In the morning we went to restaurant for breakfast but they said due to corona virus it was closed, we ate breakfast in the out the hotel. Then I backed to hotel the reception said it was open just for dinner, I don't understand the covid19 is just in the morning??? After that we prepared for dinner but I surprised because Someone had booked the whole restaurant privately so we had to go to out of the hotel because this hotel had just 1 main restaurant and this is not fair, I had a bad stay in this hotel and I don't recommend this hotel to any one 😔",negative,real
27,Le Germain,Am reviewing this hotel with much pain. Before lodging I knew I was to be charged a total of $245 as confirmed by the receptionist. I was astonished when I checked my account and realized I had an additional charge of $301 making a total of $546. When I asked they said I was charged for the few bottles of beer I drank from thier fridge. Such hidden feee should be explained ahead of time because this is exploitation. It really hurts.,negative,real
28,Le Germain,"Don't stay here, Marriott across the street 100 x better, room wise and service . Regret booking here. Notluxury at all. Room extremely dark, entire room filled with cheap bed and furnishings. Extremely unconformatable top to bottom, every thing is fake even the outlets. Loud music from the clib next door, not sound proof windows.",negative,fake
29,Le Germain,"The only good thing about this stay was the location. We arrived and they had no records of our reservation and as we were being sent away to go “figure it out” by ourselves which would’ve taken 2 hours at 8:30-9pm at night to get in contact with our bookings agent luckily a manager came to help us. Upgraded our room to a king which was great, but the room itself is so dim with barely any light source. The blinds don’t help as we faced a building so hardly any natural light comes through. Was told our damage deposit return is $200 only received $137 and told we drank two cans from the mini bar which was a lie because we don’t drink pop and the prices are insane. Just seems scammy with all the hidden fees, lies about our damage deposit and mini bar usage. Definitely won’t be returning or using hotels at all for a long time.",negative,real
30,Le Germain,"I forgot my cle de peau facial wash and a cheap feminine wash in the shower room, but they told me they can only find the feminine wash. I don’t appreciate. the dishonesty of the housekeeping department .i left both items in the place, how come they can find the cheaper one. If there is an option for 0 star, I will definitely choose that.",negative,real
31,Le Germain,"Personal I don't think this hotel is worth the price. The breakfast they offer has very little options. When we checked in we were given a key to our room, we went upstairs to unlocked the door and walked in on a couple in their bed.... They gave us a key to a room already taken. We went back down stairs will all our bags, told them what happened they said sorry about that and gave us a new room and key... All in all not a good experience. If you're charging 400 a night your staff should be trained properly. Won't be back.",negative,real
32,Le Germain,"Incredibly disappointing staff, there was no service to be found at the bar. After hunting down the concierge, he was of no help either. The lack of service was unexpected and jarring. Won’t be coming back anytime soon. Thoroughly disappointed.",negative,real
33,Le Germain,"The stay at the hotel was very good, the clean service on high level, the SPA is our favorite. However, the experience of restaurant in downstairs gave bad experience( food poisoning ) and I was happy to leave this hotel as soon as possible.",negative,real
34,Le Germain,"IF YOU LIKE SMOKED MEAT AND BACON, AND CAN APPRECIATE A VALET SERVICE THAT PUTS FOOD IN YOUR CAR WITHOUT BEING ASKED, THEN THIS IS THE HOTEL FOR YOU! Although I would love to give this hotel more than one star, my recent experience at ""one of the best hotels in Calgary"", was both disappointing, and confusing. The purpose of my trip was to surprise my wife with a birthday getaway. After reading the reviews on a number of hotels, I liked the ratings and the comments people left regarding their stay here. We checked into the hotel around 8pm Saturday night. Despite there being a valet, I asked where there was parking as the horror stories about these services leave me feeling uneasy. The front desk staff said that there was public parking for $10.00/hour, so the $30 valet seemed like a great deal. We dropped off our car, went to our room - where we stayed until we checked out the following morning. Our car was brought to the front for us, just as valets do, but when we got in, there was a horrendous smell. Sitting on the back seat was a box of take out from their restaurant. We didn't eat at their restaurant and we certainly did not order take out for our car. The box was full of smoked meat, bacon, and I am not sure what else as we were immediately enraged and went back inside. We confusingly showed the hotel staff what we found in our car. To be fair, the staff seemed just as confused as we were. After being interrogated by the staff, with questions like ""did you order food and have it delivered to your car?"", to which we replied ""who even does that?"", we came to the conclusion that CLEARLY somebody was in our vehicle who should not have been. We drove to Calgary, so we had to ride in our stinky smoked meat car for 3 hours home. After speaking to the manager, who was less than willing to accommodate our experience, we were told that it wasn't a big deal, as it was just human error. No, it was not human error, because one of your staff intentionally took my car keys for no reason, and took food to my car. There is no documentation of anyone actually asking for food to be left to stagnate in my car during the night. This was a violation of privacy to say the least, and the accusatory staff have not made it any better. In the end we were told that we would receive some of our hotel charges back, which we have, but the whole experience was mind boggling. More so the excuse after excuse received. Was it a nice hotel? The room was nice. Was it worth the hassle of having to get my car cleaned? Absolutely not. Am I confused on how this is the best hotel in Calgary? Yes Would I ever return to this hotel? NEVER. Would I order smoked meat and bacon from their restaurant? HELL NO.",negative,real
35,Le Germain,"This hotel charges you for restaurant bills outside the days you actually stayed there. I was shocked that my room was billed for restaurant charges not in my name, or my wife who was on the reservation...and there were charges from a whole day before we checked in. The charges were disputed and the hotel refuses to back down despite there being charges for days we were not even there, and the name on the receipts not matching the names on my room reservation. I honestly expected better of this hotel. I will not be staying at a Germain hotel again. Save yourself the hassle and stay at the Fairmont.",negative,real
36,Le Germain,The behaviour from restaurant was quite rude and dont care attitude. To answer a simple question on the phone they put us on hold twice for 5 to 10 minutes. Stay away from this kind of customer service,negative,real
37,Le Germain,"It's astounding that after spending a substantial amount of money weeks at a time in your hotel, our loyalty was repaid by unwarranted accusations, undignified treatment from upper management, and a complete lack of accountability and response from any members of the executives. Surely, our young family does not fit the criminal profile deserving of this mistreatment, especially having the police called on us in our room in front of our 2 year old daughter to kick us out and to cut our stay short. Why haven't we heard back from anyone on the executive team to our last email correspondence a week ago who can stand by the actions and decisions taken by their upper management team. No respect or common courtesy was given and not even an explanation to support the decisions taken by unprofessional upper management staff members. It's unfortunate that a family owned company falls so far from its #1 value of ""respect"" especially towards another family. It's almost comical that this was started by an innocent email from our family asking about a hand towel which launched an assault from the upper management team to reply with an unprofessional abrasive email which included accusations of criminal intent, threats of monetary penalties, forced removal from their property and a final management decision with no discussion. The only ""criminal"" activity that happened was that we felt that you acted like crooks who were only good at taking our money with a failure to provide a service equal to the amount you charge. ***BE WARNED that another crooked activity shown was their promise of the ""complimentary breakfast"". It should more accurately state ""only one complimentary breakfast per room"" as there's an extra hidden $30 charge per occupant for the same room type as you would stay in for a single occupant. This $30 is for them to cover their cost of offering each guest a ""complimentary breakfast"", which means that you're basically paying $30 for your complimentary breakfast. Someone in the company executive team needs to own up and take responsibility for the actions taken and honour the values and ethics that the company claims to have for their guests.",negative,real
38,Le Germain,"A surprisingly disappointing hotel. Stayed at the Westin previously on the same trip and was expecting a more upscale and refined experience but received just the opposite. The suites are nice, but cleaning service is spotty and doesn't come every day. When they did clean the rooms they use a distinctively vile cleaning substance on the floors which leaves a musty aroma throughout the room. The gym and spa center is lackluster and small compared to the Westin's rooftop pool complex. Barely any equipment and not enough room for more than 4 people at a time. The complimentary breakfast on the second floor was inedible. I have eaten better breakfasts at a Motel6 in the states. The eggs were nearly plastic and the sausages had a peculiar rubber texture. Overall a very disappointing experience. Would certainly not stay here again.",negative,real

42,Le Germain,"I had the most inconsiderate experience at a hotel at Le Germain. I was booked for two nights at Le Germain for a business trip. I do not have a credit card, so my company prepaid for my room. When I arrived at Le Germain at 11:30pm, I was told I had to provide an additional $600 in cash per night as a deposit for incidentals. After stating I simply did not have an extra $600 a night, the hotel stated they would lower it to $300. In addition, I was told the minibar would have to be locked because I didn't have a credit card. This was insulting. I attempted to transfer this from my savings account to my chequing account online. However, due to the late hour, the transfer did not go through immediately and my debit card continued to get declined. I asked if I could call a colleague and have them give their credit card information. The hotel said no. The hotel gave me no options. Even though my company had prepaid for my room. I was not allowed to stay in the room. Le Germain essentially kicked me out onto the streets of Calgary at 11:30pm, a single woman alone in a city I've never been before, to look for alternative accommodation. I will stress again, my room had been paid for. I will never stay at this hotel again in my life. I was mortified, and treated as though I was subhuman. I didn't know where to go when I left and was nervous for my safety.",negative,real

46,Le Germain,"Nice location, and easy to find, since it's right across from Calgary Tower. The room was alright, could have been cleaner. The amenities were lacking - they had no carry-on size shampoo and conditioner, only large dispensers that were chained to the showers.Everything about our stay was just ok. Not really worth the high price point of this hotel. The treatment of the front desk left a sour taste from our visit. We were greeted by the front desk staff wear his mask on his chin (why bother wearing a chin diaper?). He was standoffish and made us feel like gum on his soles from the look he gave us. Perhaps it was because we looked young and I was holding a stuffed squishmallow gift. I expect the service to be a little more refined for the prices this hotel charges.",negative,real
47,Le Germain,Very over priced for what you are getting. The underground parking is honestly terrible! Have to drive forever to find a spot everything is reserved. The lighting in the rooms is very inefficient. Random buttons turn on random lights. For the price way more amenities should be included. The beds are comfy and so are the pillows. Very unfriendly room for kids.,negative,real
48,Le Germain,"When my wife and I arrived, we were told our booking wasn't in the system. We even had an email confirmation. They were never able to find our reservation, and we were forced to pay for a different room that wasn't want we originally wanted. After that however, the experience was more pleasant. Room was comfortable and clean, and all the employees we encountered were very warm and kind",negative,real
49,Le Germain,"The hotel staff were not friendly and the room was incredibly rundown. We have stayed at Le Germain in Toronto and had quite high expectations that the experience would be similar but it was anything but not. Not to mention that the Parking lot is before the hotel on a one way, we were forced to go through an alley where there were a bunch of junkies. I guess that's normal for DT. The hotel is fair but our expectations were not met and that's the reason for the 2/5 stars.",negative,real
50,Le Germain,"Ussualy don't write reviews but was a little disappointed with the cleanliness of my room. Overall the staff has been great the rooms are beautiful and the breakfast was great. Only problem was the room. When we arrived one of the bedsheets had a stain that looked like a face of makeup, which they promptly replaced. Later I noticed that the carpet has white stains and there is what looks like urine on the walls around the toilet. And lastly our door was left unlocked when the maids cleaned the rooms. I'm hoping this is a one off and not a reflection of the hotel. Overall, I'm disappointed with the stay as my expectations were quite high considering the quality of the reputation.",negative,real

And the continental breakfast was probably the best we have ever had - fresh food and laid out perfectly. We received a free room upgrade when we came which was a nice surprise for us.

79,The Elan,"I have stayed at the Elan for several years as the location suits my purpose.

My son who was in town to compete in an important tennis tournament had. Suit with not even one drawer in the room! The rooms are clean but way too dreary and our views were simply dreadful. I think it is expensive for what it is , and charging $20 for parking is over the top. The place has deteriorated since I stayed in the early days. The good is the breakfast. Perfect. Unfortunately the area is filled with homeless, so this is not a great area inwhich to stay unless you have a reason to be in Cslgsry and won’t be in your room except briefly.

89,The Elan,It was a girls night out so we rented a room in Calgary. This place was amazing. It was very clean. Our suite was beautiful it had 2 separate bedrooms with your own iron. Since one of our gf likes to iron her clothes. Each room had its own TV and u can set Ur own temperature. Shower was super awesome. And the toilet lights up. Set the mood hahaha and the toilet seats were heated!! How cool is that. Our place had a small kitchen set up. Sofa and dining table. Overall. I will definitely come back. And one more thing. Free breakfast!!,positive,real
90,The Elan,"I stayed at the hotel in October 2013, and enjoyed so many of the unique aspects of the hotel. From the friendly service at check in to the beautiful design, and being within a short walk from so many neat little restaurants- like Farm and 80th and Ivy. The key shelf was such a great idea as it was very handy when arriving into the room! The beds were extremely comfortable, and the bathroom spacious with a huge bathtub that was very relaxing to sit in each night. The small kitchen was handy as we had our young daughter with us, and I helped myself to a few of the minibar items, as it was pretty awesome that everything was under $5! All in all, a very enjoyable stay.",positive,real

Hotel is well maintained, with staff who make sure you have everything you need, are knowledgeable about the area, offer great advice on local restaurants and places of interest. Complimentary buffet breakfast is the best I've had at a hotel. Everything is fresh and there are a lot of choices that change daily. Beds are comfortable, bathrooms are large (heated toilet seat... love it). Internet is super fast (for a hotel) at 15mbps. Don't let the slight out of the way placement discourage you!

116,Residence Inn By Mariott Downtown,"Me and my husband recently stayed here with our 3 year old daughter. We had such a great experience. Our 1 bedroom suite was so spacious. It did not feel like a hotel but more of a condo. It had a fridge, cooktop, dishwasher/sink, microwave. This was so convenient with a child. There was also much room for her to play in the room. We also loved the fact that the tv channels were preloaded with Netflix, YouTube and Amazon. All we had to do was sign in to access it all. The location was very convenient as well; in the heart of downtown! Hotel parking is expensive but you can use a third party company to pay for parking; it's very inexpensive. The breakfast at the hotel is comparable to a 5 star all inclusive resort. There's so many choices and everything was delicious!

I appreciated the convenient placement of the smart control panels in my room—being able to control my room lighting, the blinds, and the room temperature from the comfort of the bed seems small, but the convenience goes to show this room was designed to put your comfort first. The water pressure in the shower was great, and the temperature was easy to control. Alt Hotel even accepted a package for me that my courier was unable to drop at my own home 90 minutes away. If I *had* to be critical of anything, it's that the closet design was a little tricky—rather than a traditional closet where the hangers face in, the hangers face towards you, which made taking clothes in & out somewhat cumbersome, but really not a huge deal when you factor in how great the rest of your stay is :) I'll definitely be back.

WTFudge am I supposed to do with three decaf k-cups??? Total BS!!!!! Only place to smoke is outside with the transients asking for a dart or spare change. Limited snackage options. No pool! Treadmills face the wall and not the TV or the beautiful windows. Shower needs a lil CLR. Better options elsewhere downtown.,negative,real

Sub-lukewarm water was as hot as it got for both the tap and shower. Called their help line - apparently they ar aware it's finnicky to get it hot. Even after their helpful tips, I managed to get it hot for a split second before it went sheer cold. Guess a hot shower ain't happening. Got a good sleep in their cozy bed. Smart for them to have a chromecast installed for your Netflix viewing pleasures. Then we were woken up to the bright beautiful sun... their blackout curtains have a pleasant gap right smack in the middle. If you're a morning person, not a problem but sleeping in is not an option. Yup... pretty grumpy now.",negative,real

Not the most central hotel but if you enjoy a walk along the river then you do have that. I think this hotel has the potential to be a 3.5 maybe 4 however I'm giving them a 2 because of the loud early morning construction of the building across the street. They did supply ear plugs but I didn't know until the morning when it woke me up.,negative,real

I never use the glasses in a hotel room but still no way to get a good first impression. Room was small but hallway was very large to get to the bedroom. Wasted space for sure. Bathroom small and shower leaked so very bad that we had to ask for extra towels just to soak up the water. We told the front desk and they just said it was the design. Maybe they should have suggested that they move us but that never happened. Restaurant in the hotel is still not open a year after the opened the hotel so you have to go looking for a place to eat.

193,Alt Hotel Calgary East Village,"From the moment we arrived, the front desk staff were on their cell phones and very casual. Not a deal breaker, but certainly a sign of worse things to come. Trying to choke down the fact that I just paid their $30 parking fee for one night's stay, I immediately took inventory of the room, which hosted a king sized bed and dwarfed the tiny room. Also, no fridge, just a small desk propped up next to the bed. Very claustrophobic. The linens had a foul odour to them as though they'd not been properly washed. That, or the pillow itself was the culprit; I couldn't tell, and didn't investigate further. Making the best of the disappointing first impression, I decided to order room service. 'Not happening. Apparently there is no room service. They just refer you to the Japanese place in the lobby... Moving on to the bathroom; the shower was decent, but I didn't realize that the seal on the door left a major gap. The result was a pool of water on the floor upon exiting the shower. It took 3 towels to mop it up. Turning to the room controls, the touch panel features, such as the blinds and lights are an unnecessary gimmick once you take into account that the room is otherwise deficient. It seems as though this hotel is determined to give the illusion of modern comfort, but after little observation, it becomes quite clear that they've put a silk hat on a pig. I won't be be staying here again. And I encourage others to explore better options.",negative,real

195,Alt Hotel Calgary East Village,"Flew into Calgary in the evening and stayed for a Friday night at the ALT Hotel. At exactly 7AMon Staurday, the jack hammers and compressors started on the high rise that is immediately adjacent and was opposite our room. Our room was on the 7th foor - most of the construction noise was coming from the 6th floor of the neighboring building. I asked the front desk to move us to the opposite side of the hotel and by 7:30AM we were moved to a room on the ""quiet"" side of the ALT. The young guys at the front desk were responsive although I was asked to wait 15 minutes at the front desk while they ""made the case"" for the room change on heir computer terminal. It turns out that this is not uncommon and that others had complained and had been moved every day over the past couple months . The hotel was new (restaurant still under construction and not open yet) and I am left with the following questions: 1) If the Hotel was at 50% occupancy, why were we assigned a room on the NOISY side of the hotel? 2) Let me be clear - this was NOT a little noise. This was cacophony! Banging! Pounding! It was unbelievable. How can they believe that ANYONE would be comfortable on that side of the hotel? 3) If they are moving clients each day, they should have made changes to both room assignment procedures in the evening and response time in the AM (""Please sit over there as I need time to make a case for your room change""????)

Due to rush hour traffic, we had to stop our car in front of the hotel parking entrance and wait for the light, this guest service agent came to us and knocked at our window in a very aggressive manner. I lowered the window and politely said, Hello? The reply of hers was not “Hello? “Or “Excuse me”, she was just very angry and yelled very loudly at my husband: “You guys need to move! Yes, back off!"" We were shocked that we were spoken to at this way by a hotel staff, but we were happy to do so, however, the car behind us didn't allow enough room for us to do so. She yelled at us again ""Okay! Now you can't back off!"" and she rolled her eyes at me, and said ""There is a sign there, read the sign!”. She was very rude and very disrespectful with her communications. I felt extremely awful about being yelled. Just when I was able to ask her to calm down, I witnessed there was a pedestrian trying to cross the path past the parkade entrance, she yelled at this person and said ""hey, you, stop!"" This guest was shocked and said, ""Excuse me, are you serious?"" The guest service agent replied, ""Yes! I am dead serious"". And the yelling continued. This 45 seconds interaction negatively impacted my day. Now, I was able to tell you exactly what happened, because it just happened to me 48 hours ago. I may not remember any details months later, but I will always remember how this guest service agent made me feel, as the experience forever affected my perception towards the Hyatt Brand and the Hyatt employees’ professionalism as a whole. I personally think that if you are not patient and do not know how to carry yourself in a professional manner in a stressful situation, you should not be in a hospitality industry. I strongly feel that I was being verbally abused by your employee, and I think no one should be treated like no body. Finally, I demand an official apology from your general manager.",negative,real

We were in a pet friendly room and had a bowl of water down for our two small dogs. It was dark and I stepped into water and thought I had knocked the water bowl over. I turned the light on and saw that I was standing in toilet water. I woke up my fiancé and told him the bathroom was flooded. He was frustrated because he just got to sleep. He called the front desk to let them know we needed a new room and they said they would call us back when they figured something out. I guess because we had our dogs it was hard to find another dog friendly room, even though I’m pretty sure the hotel wasn’t even close to full. We waited for a call back and after 5 minutes my fiancé decided to go to the lobby because he wanted to get back to sleep. He told me that he was frustrated, and probably rude, but that the person at the front desk was not being very helpful at first. They finally came to our room with new room keys and offered to help us move rooms. We moved to the other side of the hotel. Still a nice room but on the side of the hotel that I know is cheaper. My fiancé apologized to the person at the front desk for having a short temper and we thanked him for moving us. He said that a manager would follow up with us via email in the next day or two. We never got a follow up. When I checked out the next day the new person at the front desk was confused as to why I had a new room and I explained thinking that she might have apologized or given me a small discount but she didn’t.

354,Best Western Plus Suites Downtown,"I stayed here for one night, Jul 08-09 2021, in room 705. The hotel isn't fancy, but it was one of the cheapest in the downtown area, and close enough to the core to be easily walkable. Yet I really enjoyed this hotel and it was one of the best low-cost hotels I've ever stayed in. It felt cozy. Part of it was that I lucked out with an east-facing room and had a grand view of the downtown buildings and their night city lights right from my bed, lying down on my pillow after I opened the curtains. This gave me an aesthetic that I enjoyed a lot, and made me feel like a princess. (I attached a picture of the view from my pillow. Of course the curtains can always be closed at night, I just left it open because I enjoyed it.) The other major plus factor was the kitchenette, which I don't see often enough in hotel rooms but I really appreciate. I was able to get clean water by just boiling a pot of water, whereas in many other hotels I get stuck with using the terrible coffee filter/pot to get clean water. The one drawback I faced in my one night there was that the room wireless was supposed to have a password on it, but none was set, so the network was basically open to the public and that's dangerous. I'm not sure if that was a hotel-wide open wifi or just localized to my room, since it seemed like each room was supposed to have a different wifi password. The front desk staff member tried to give me the password to their internal secured network though, but that didn't work for whatever reason. But at least he tried, and I appreciated that.",positive,real

357,Best Western Plus Suites Downtown,"My wife and I stayed in the Best Western Plus on 8th Street SW, Calgary for several days in August, 2021. I have to say that the entire experience from check in to departure far exceeded our expectations. We stayed in a double room on the 5th floor with a kitchenette, fridge and stove. The beds were amazing with soft mattress and pillows, giving us a great sleep and a lamp (the turn on/off switch was easy to see) between the beds to allow us to read and have coffee in the mornings. There was no noise during sleeping hours and the blackout blinds were very effective. The bathroom too was easily accessible, particularly in the middle of the night! The door of the bathroom opened outwards which meant you didn't have to fight with it once in the bathroom; more space in the bathroom. We also had real soap as opposed to the gels they currently offer in most hotels. Identifying and opening the small shampoo bottles was a challenge, as it is in all hotels and of course you only realize the challenge after you are in the shower, half blind and with wet hands. The room was carpeted which I personally liked and gave a senses of comfort and warmth, not to mention less chance of slipping on a wooden floor! The shower worked well and even I could figure it out without a Phd in mechanical engineering. The TV channel changer worked amazingly with three or four buttons, turn on, turn off, volume and channel changer- like I said I like simplicity. The air conditioning system was perfect and you could see the response immediately when you pushed the button; I could even see the temperature readings without my glasses. The breakfasts were good with sausages, egg pancakes, toast, porridge and juices. i could go on, the room was quiet although we usually bring a fan to drown out background noise. The check in process was very friendly and all the staff Abbi, in particular very friendly and accomodating The experience was so good we asked and received the same room again for another few days. The area in which the hotel is situated has access to many wonderful restaurants and cafes, not to mention the downtown area of Calgary.

First room provided had a filthy carpet - ripped off from all possible corners one could see, stains on burner, and cupboard having bread crumbs. Upon making a complaint cleaning guys were sent to our room to check if that’s the case. They accepted their mistake of not cleaning the bread crumbs from cupboard, but every other things I mentioned they denied saying it’s the company’s fault that they don’t replace it, not us. However they changed the room and that seemingly looked a lot better until we woke up from our little nap and found rashes on our bodies from bug bites. I would have let every other thing go but with this thing we could not even sleep. We went straight down to front desk for check-out and told them all the problems we experienced. He apologized and said he will still charge me some amount and some he will take care. Like my question is I had to get a new hotel last minute, paid them a full night cost, because of you not providing a great service as what is advertised. And on top you are telling me I still will have to pay some amount. Amount is not a big amount but the charge is charge. I technically paid half of your nightly cost plus a full-night cost at the other hotel for something that was not even my problem. I understand things happen, therefore I waited this long to write a review. Not to deny, the general manager followed up with me 4 days after my check-out. He sent me an email indicating he apologized that my ‘stay didn’t exceed the expectation.’ Since this email didn’t do much for me, rather just an apology I responded him back saying the amount I got charged should be refunded as i think it’s not fair to charge someone when you can’t provide them for what you promise you will.

On Friday night my boyfriend had been jumped at a bar for no reason, because of it we immediately went back to our hotel to get some ice on his eye to keep it from bruising too much. When we came into the hotel one of the security guards was standing at the door, and seen my boyfriend had a slightly swollen eye, a bloody mouth, and his shirt was ripped. I came down from my room asking the security guard (since there was no one at the front desk) if there was bags, and ice available. The Security guard (without answering my question) began to accuse my boyfriend of fighting in the hotel room, and told us we would be kicked out if there was any noise complaints or if he continued to fight. When I explained that my boyfriend had been jumped at a bar and he needed ice for his eye the security guard basically accused me of lying saying that he saw my boyfriend come in, and what not. I went back up to my hotel to find something to compensate for the bag I could not find. When I told my friend (who was in the other hotel room) about what the security guard had said to me, we then looked out of the room and the security guard was standing outside of our rooms monitoring them . We stepped out of the room asking him why he was monitoring our rooms just for him to tell us that he was doing his rounds. Our door then locked behind us and we were forced to go downstairs to the front desk to get a key so we could get back into the room. The gentlemen at the front desk was rude as well. He told us he needed to see ID from us to be able to get a key for the room we then explained we got locked out of our room cause we were talking to the security guard about why he found it necessary to watch our rooms. The gentlemen at the front desk began to tell us if we got a noise complaint we would be kicked out, when all we wanted was a key to our room so we could go to bed!! When we finally got a key for our room and went back upstairs to go to bed the security guard was still up there watching both our rooms. I was absolutely furious over the fact that your staff accused my boyfriend of fighting in your hotel when he was actually jumped! The fact that someone had told the security to monitor our room is so ridiculous. BUT that's not the end of it. When we woke up in the morning my boyfriend went into the bathroom to shower. When he got out of the shower he grabbed a towel and there was what looked to be a feces stain on it. We also noticed while getting ready that there was blood on our curtains, and honestly seeing this stuff did not add to how upset I was about how we were treated the night before. I hope you do something about how your staff treated me, and my friends so no one else feels the way we did that night. ( I also provided photos of the blood and marks on the towel.)

We chose to stay at this particular hotel, as it was my daughters 9th birthday, and we wanted to do something extra special, as she was been sent on a plane by herself for the first time the next day.    Now, I have stayed at this hotel in the past, but they must have recently done some renovations on the rooms, as I don’t remember them being that nice.    Upon check-in, my wife and daughter were overjoyed to see such a beautiful, elegant lobby.  The décor is classy, and an atmosphere that exudes opulence.

Its lobby is beautiful, and our room was superb.  The location is extremely convenient.  We had planned to take a city bus tour just to get the lay of the land, but instead opted to ride the elevator in the Calgary Tower to its top, and take a visual, recorded tour of the city.  That filled us in very well, as good as a bus tour, and much quicker.  We had dinner in the hotel’s lobby lounge and ate from the bar menu.  We shared a golden beet salad (excellent) and an order of steamed mussels in a light curry sauce, which was delicious, not too spicy. This was a very nice oasis on our drive across western Canada.",positive,real
413,Fairmont Palliser,"Stayed one night in Calgary during the Stampede and found that this hotel lived up to the typical standards of a Fairmont - great service and location within a classic, historic building. We were given an upgraded room with more modern bathroom finishings so that contributed to our positive experience. One complaint (or suggestion) I would note was with the valet service - I would recommend that for the $38 valet charge they should include at least a windshield clean (lots of summer bugs after a long highway trip) and perhaps some bottled water and/or a few cookies in the vehicle at checkout like the Fairmont Seattle has done in the past. These are the little low cost or no cost extras that would help ensure travelers give more positive reviews.",positive,real

The menu variety included gluten free, raw, vegetarian and vegan as well as regular food. We ate from both the gluten free and vegetarian menu choices and enjoyed it all. Although more expensive then my typical hotel stay, it was worth the extra for this somewhat stressful business trip.  Make sure to have the local currency as it makes life so much easier.

Very disappointed with the quality of the mattress as it was harder than expected and I prefer firm mattresses too. And also the newness of the hotel didn’t make up for the tonic restaurant’s lack of quality in their food. Just ordered a pretzel and cheese dip, pretzel was raw. Didn’t offer me anything else to eat as it was close to closing time I guess. Just didn’t pay for it of course because I couldn’t eat it. Complimentary breakfast. Ordered waffles but they brought me pancakes instead. Didn’t tell me there were no waffles they just decided I would eat pancakes I guess? I sent back because I didn’t want pancakes.

I am more than aware that many restrictions are in place but still a hotel of this class should still be able to maintain a certain standard.To start with, the breakfast was an absolute desaster. Breakfast had to be picked up from the bar and be taken to your room - which is of course more than ok in these times. They offered a breakfast bagel which was half frozen and which you had to prepare by yourself in the microwave. The taste of the bagel was kind of strange - to say it in a polite way - and you would have become something better in any motel or bed and breakfast. If you were lucky, you could also get some mini croissants, yogurt and cereal. As I said - if you were lucky - because the hotel had problems managing their stocks. One morning, for example, there wasn’t any milk at all for breakfast. There wasn’t any bread at all. That’s not all, on top, all the food was put in paper bags and you were given a rubbish bag to carry everything to your room!The rooms are nice and spacious, however the cleanliness of the rooms could be better. We did find left overs of previous guests - in these kind of times you expect a certain level of sanitation in the rooms. We booked a room with kitchenette so that we were able to cook our own food.

It's good that it was busy but the hotel is poorly managed and does not clean or maintain the common areas, despite the fact that we are in the middle of Covid-19 pandemic. Many of the guests ran around misbehaving as if it's a party in their private residence. The dining area were mostly packed with almost no one wearing masks and no physical distancing. Elevators were rarely cleaned. The indoor Pool area and outdoor patio was a mess. The underground parkade was still dirty, though not as bad as last April. The elevator lobby area in the parkade was filthy with garbage piling up daily ( eventually removed on day 8 of our stay). Luggage carts hard to find or unavailable. Transient degenerates and homeless people constantly loitering at front and nearby hotel, making further mess.

Iv’e had a positive experience with Radison hotels before, but this interaction with “Debbie” changed everything for us.On Oct 11 at 9:30PM I called the front desk and kindly requested bath towels to #401. Debbie abruptly cuts me off and instructs me to “come down and get ‘em I can’t come right now”. Her unprofessional demeanor and condescending tone shocked me. When asked about how one would make a complaint about the service at the hotel, Debbie tells me to email her the complaint and then proceeded to laugh. I was shocked by her lack of respect for my concern. Didn’t think it could get worse but then her evasive attitude grew when I inquired on complaint handling and escalation protocols. She continued to remind me that she was “in charge” hinting that the complaint will be ignored. Debbie has no regard for tactful communication - cutting me off at every moment she could. Her listening skills are non existent. In 20 years of travelling Ive never witnessed a “hotel manager” act with such wilful neglect.I would highly recommend staying anywhere but this Radison. Now if you do end up there, bring your own towels and expect to get laughed at you when you make a complaint to management.",negative,real

Im pretty sure Presendents choice sells frozen prime rib burgers, that probably what it was. JEEZE, Marriott is making a fortune charging $18 per burger when a box of them is about 10 dollars in store. PLUS, our burgers were slathered in PROCESSED CHEESE. It was DISGUSTING. Neither of us finished our burgers. The crab dip appy was INEDIBLE. Im not exaggerating....i dont think it was actually crab. It was mystery substance covered 4 inches deep in oily disgusting cheese.

784,Residence Inn by Marriot South,"This is not a good place to stay!We stayed 2 nights in a one bedroom suite. Along with us were also 3 other family groups staying in adjacent one bedroom suits making up our family. This was supposed to be a fun family get together where grandparents, children and grand children had planned an excursion to take in ""The Polar Express"" ride outside of Calgary. The ride was great but the hotel experience was awful!A noisy heating system kept those members of the family sleeping in the main room up all night. This noise was further added to by a noisy refrigerator. While in the bathroom we could clearly hear our neighbours conversations.The breakfast was ok but they moved people out so they could lock up 15 minutes early.Last night at 7:00 p.m. we brought in pizza and birthday cake and because there were 13 of us we opted to use the open breakfast tables that were open to the main hotel courtyard. No hotel guests were in the lobby during the entire 30 minutes that we were eating our pizza. During our meal the hotel manager very rudely berated us and chastised us for what we had done even though there were no signs indicating that the area was restricted to the morning breakfast period. The toddlers in our group had to immediately give up their high chairs and leave the lobby. Our group consisting of 4 grandparents, one uncle, 4 parents and 4 preschoolers were made to feel like a group of unruly teenagers partying in the middle of the night.

785,Residence Inn by Marriot South,"We checked into this hotel August 11th, 2018. Everything seemed on the up and up, modern, fresh, clean and the reception staff was efficient. Things started to go downhill when we reached the second floor where our room was located. The sign on the wall directed clients to rooms up to room 219. How could this be? So we asked a member of the cleaning staff where our room was and she directed us to the end of a hallway. We found our room adjacent to the connector to the spa/pool area, another stairwell and entrance to the fitness center. We should have went back down to the reception area and demanded another room or left and went to another facility, but we did not. We were to attend a social function in the area and did not have time to fool around so thought how bad could it be? The room was well equipped (fridge,stove, microwave, toaster, dishes etc.) all you would ever need and clean. That evening we returned to our room for some much needed rest after a very long day of travel to find that our room was the social hub of the second floor along with family groups gathering outside along with the accompanying banging doors and general loud conversations. To make matters worse the HVAC system was very loud (akin to a truck engine running in our room). So in addition to loud people, banging doors we now had to listen to the HVAC system roaring every time it fired up. My wife who is very easy going in general spoke with the staff in the AM and told them of our experience. She was told that ""she should have asked for a room that was not in the vicinity of the fitness center"". I guess it never occurred to the staff member that perhaps room 221 be used as a last resort. We feel that we were treated very shabbily in being given this room as it should only be made available to overnight staff in times of emergency. It is obviously a money grab when used to accommodate unsuspecting clients. Shame on Marriott, shame on me for accepting sub quality service and accommodations. Spoiled our trip.Additional tips to the franchise would be to have enough forks on hand (perhaps buy an additional 50 forks so that when the dishwashers were stacked up, one didn't have to wait 10 minutes for a utensil to eat their breakfast) so that scrambled eggs could be eaten without using a tablespoon and to have the coffee carafes full in the breakfast room. Waiting for a fork would have been more acceptable if we had the luxury of a cup of coffee.In closing just let me recommend that if you are ever offered room 221 RUN don't WALK to another hotel that purports to be a class establishment.

786,Residence Inn by Marriot South,"FIRST. This is a 7 month old hotel. Remember that.THE GOOD:Easy to find.Looks good from the outside.Very good, professional staff with 1 exception (see below)Nice parking lot includes underground parking.Complimentary wifiTHE BAD:Lobby is fairly plain.The room had multiple issues with loose or broken bathroom fixtures.The shower curtain doesn't fall into the bathtub but rests about 1 inch above the lip of the tub. Meaning that, after your shower, there will be a small wading pool waiting for you on the bathroom floor.The pool is accessed from the 2nd floor only. What if there's an emergency? How will emergency personnel get to the pool and get an injured person out?No movie options on the TV (I get movie options at hotels that charge much less)No complimentary water (I get complimentary water at hotels that charge much less)I began to mention some of this to the front desk manager, who remarked ""...well you have to expect these things with a new hotel..."". Actually, I expect ""these things"" with an old two star hotel that costs under $100 per night. NOT with a 7 month old hotel, bearing the Marriott brand and costing over $250 per night.",negative,real

I couldn't beleive the invoice, even the front desk person wouldn't meet my eyes when explaining the charges. He just mumbled some crap about them being mandatory.

The tub wouldn't drain, the fireplace didn't work and the closet door tracks were broken and the mirror panel almost fell on my son. The customer service was the absolute worst I have ever experienced at a hotel. Every time I spoke to someone I got a different answer or the staff refused to help at all. I asked to have my sons surprise birthday gift that was being delivered (larger edible arrangement and snacks already paid for and ready to be left in room) dropped off in our hotel room when we were at dinner, so that he could come back to a surprise. I called the day before to make sure this was ok and was told it was. However on the day of, I was told that they didn't do that and they couldn't help and we would have to come pick it up from the front desk ourselves after dinner. So instead of the 3 men behind the front desk even offering to help us carry the items upstairs, myself and my two small children did it. The final straw was checkout where I was carrying everything down the stairs and to my car. I should have done two trips but my son had just had a bad reaction to the pool chemicals and I needed to get him home. A staff member stopped me. I was grateful, thinking they were going to offer to help carry some things and instead she asked what room I was leaving from. Once I told her she just walked away.

Drove down from edmonton with our 4 kids for the night and were super disappointed to see how tiny the actual pool was. The pictures made it look huge. It's tiny and shallow which is good for small kids but our 9year Olds didn't find it fun at all. The place was absolutely PACKED. Total mayhem. Wall to wall people, total choqs. In the hot tub it was shoulder to shoulder, pool was the same, no chairs so people are standing. It was horrible. The water was a gross shade and dirty. No sanitization practices being done in any way. One person on duty in the area which is laughable considering the hundreds that were in that space. We came back at 930pm to do the last half hour and it hadn't even slowed down a little bit. The rooms were very old and dated, no plug ins worked and no nightstand to set your cup or phone. For the price we paid for two adjoining rooms, we had higher expectations. We justified the higher price (without breakfast included) as being due to the ""huge pool and waterslides"". Not worth it in the slightest. Would have stayed at a place that included breakfast with maybeonly one slide but a larger, less crowded pool had we had any idea what we were in for.We are quite easy to please and I never leave bad reviews but this was truly a bad experience.

It was incredible to have a manager greet us after hours and under tough (smokey) conditions with such a desire to meet our every need.We ended up ordering room service and had an incredible steak dinner. All the meals we had from the Rendezvous Restaurant were outstanding. I'd drive to Calgary just for their angel hair and lobster pasta, and creme brulee!Throughout our stay we interacted with the staff several times and each time they were the epitome of excellent customer service. I wish I could name them all to recognize how much we appreciated their superb care. From restaurant Manager Taylor and his serving team of Brea and Reichelle, to Director of Sales Laura, to the front desk team of Darlene and many others, to the folks who delivered ice to our room, we thank you!",positive,real

Not to mention, no continental breakfast, just a restaurant that’s cheapest plate is 35$ The coldest most inconsiderate staff that do their best to get every single dime they can from you.

Although temperature controls were backwards on faucet. Plus Tap in sink was loose and fell off. Add to that A long wait as one elevator was broken down.Tipping my opinion was that we Needed to check out at 5am. Front desk person was trying to accommodate a man who needed to stay longer as his mom was dying in the hospital but wouldn’t honor the hospital rate for him again as they were apparently busier that night. Even though the person he had checked out with earlier that morning told home they would honor it.Kind of left a bad taste in the mouth. Overall not sure I would stay there again.,negative,real
894,Courtyard by Marriot South,"This review is for the HOTEL RESTAURANT. It is TERRIBLE. Low quality, faux food at 4 star prices. I am appalled that this is what we get at a Marriott.We ordered the ‘French dip shaved beef with aged cheddar’ - and what i got was slices of processed roast beef with cheese slices. Gross. The turkey BLT - all processed meat too.I called the restaurant to complain and he said he would give us some new food so that we would be happy. I actually asked, do you have any REAL meat on the menu, whats real?So, we both ordered the PRIME RIB BURGER at $18 each.When i picked it up the employee said he really hopes i will be more satisfied with this food.REALLY?!!?IT WAS FROZEN BURGERS. Im pretty sure Presendents choice sells frozen prime rib burgers, that probably what it was. JEEZE, Marriott is making a fortune charging $18 per burger when a box of them is about 10 dollars in store. PLUS, our burgers were slathered in PROCESSED CHEESE. It was DISGUSTING. Neither of us finished our burgers. The crab dip appy was INEDIBLE. Im not exaggerating....i dont think it was actually crab. It was mystery substance covered 4 inches deep in oily disgusting cheese. Needless to say, we did not eat that either.What a huge disappointment and inconvenience for us. Marriott should be embarrassed and ashamed.",negative,real
895,Courtyard by Marriot South,"First off when we arrived we had to show confirmation of our rate.The Front Office manager did not ask for it. We went up to our room and it was a pleasant stay until the time of check-out.At 9:00 am we received calls to our room saying we need a form for your designated rate, and at that time we did not have it. The front desk clerk was extremely rude on the phone. I went down to the front desk and he was like I need it now. I explained that I did not have it, so I got in contact with my contact and she sent it to him. That point, I then asked to speak with the front office manager. I explained how rude her front desk agent was and she said sometimes our front desk agents don't extend the warmth to people the rate you are travelling with. Which I thought was absurd - your in hospitality whether you are travelling on an associates rate or not you should be offered a level of customer service. Anyways - the front office manager saw the letter that was sent and she said ""I will accept this, however I will need to clarify something with your contact"". I confirmed saying will the rate be staying the same, she said ""yes"" so I walked away thinking we were done.A week later I receive an email from the front office manager saying I was unable to get in touch with your contact, so we will need to change your rate to the original rate. I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF A HOTEL TAKING AWAY SOMEONES RATE AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN PROMISED A CERTAIN RATE. Spoke with the general manager who was very polite and understanding, however at the end of the day he could not do much for us.Please read this before booking at this hotel.

897,Courtyard by Marriot South,"My husband and I recently stayed at The Courtyard Marriott and I wanted to share our experience:For our wedding day, my husband would be “tying the knot” in Okotoks on a big acreage, surrounded by friends and family. After the festivities of the big day, we would need a nice hotel to retreat to, and enjoy the rest of the night together.The hotel needed to be located close the wedding venue, but more importantly, it needed to be able to deliver a very special and remarkable experience for my husband and I. So I did some research online and made some phone calls.I called Courtyard Marriott and chatted with their reservation agent for quite some time. Of course mentioned our wedding and that the stay would in celebration of our first night as together as Mr. & Mrs.The agent was excited for us and seemed very nice. She assured me that we would have a very pleasant stay and that they would make every effort to make our marriage-night-stay a remarkable one.We weren't expecting them to roll out the red carpet, but it's nice when a hotel can go above and beyond and deliver that extra special experience for its guests.After a beautiful wedding surrounded by loved ones, and a night filled with singing and dancing, we were exhausted. We were also excited to get to the hotel and finally be alone together. My husband and I left the wedding celebrations just before the clock struck 12. We arrived at Courtyard Marriott still fully decked out in tuxedo and wedding gown. We were greeted by the customer service agent who asked for our ID and credit card. We quickly realized that in our haste to leave and with all the excitement of the day, the bag with the ID and credit cards in it had been forgotten in the room where I changed into my gown. The clerk told us she would not be able to check us into our room until we could present the credit card and ID. Clearly a bit of a problem.My husband and I had just drove 45 min from the wedding venue to the hotel. To drive back would take another two hours round-trip, so the last thing we wanted to do was head back to retrieve the cards.Rather than getting upset, we tried suggesting some easy solutions. Knowing I was a tired bride, my husband asked the clerk if I could just go up to the room and relax while he sorted everything out. He thought maybe he could have pictures of the ID and credit cards texted to us so she could verify the information, and then he would arrange to have the cards delivered shortly thereafter.This would allow us to continue enjoying our special day and still have everything sorted out before long. The clerk told him that nothing could be done without the cards.My husband had around $400 on him, so he asked if he could secure the room with a cash deposit. Plus the hotel already had all my CC information on file because I had provided it already when I initially booked the room. She never even addressed the cash deposit and told him she was unable use the card already on file without the actual CC there; not even temporarily.Although the clerk was never outright rude to us, she treated us like strangers who had just stumbled in off the streets. It's not as though we were intoxicated and being unreasonable, I enjoyed a glass or two of champagne and my husband doesn’t drink.It was becoming clear to us that either the clerk was unable or unwilling to extend any type hospitality towards us, nor offer any helpful suggestions. What could have been just a minor ""hiccup"" was quickly turning into a wedding disaster.Nearly in tears at this point, I started calling people still enjoying the wedding party while my husband continued to discuss possible solutions with the clerk.* He asked if he could pay cash for the deposit,*He asked if if I could go up to the room, get out of my gown and relax while they figure things out.*He asked if we could check in, make a few phone calls and have everything she needed, delivered within an hour. Still we were told nothing could be done until we provided her the credit cards and ID.After the 45 minutes of talking in circles with the lobby clerk, my husband again suggested he could pay cash and, for whatever reason, she finally agreed.Stunned by how complicated and unpleasant the check-in experience had been, we went up to the room. We opened the door to a new and clean hotel room. Nothing extra, again no effort by Marriott to show that they're in the hospitality industry to impress their guests and make their brand a clear choice when considering accommodations.When we woke up in the morning there was a note under the door asking us to join them for complimentary breakfast...no thanks. To say we we were disappointed would be a huge understatement, more like appalled.We still don’t know why it took over an hour for us to check-in that night.Perhaps the lady working was alone and had no management support to help her figure things out. One would think that any manager on-sight that night couldn't possibly be unaware of the situation unfolding at their check-in counter. It would be hard to miss a frantic groom and upset bride, still in their wedding clothes, trying to check-in at 1am. We were at the check-in desk for nearly an hour.Maybe she was overwhelmed by the situation and unsure if she was allowed to authorize that sort of an exception. Surely she could have reached out for support from her team and explained the situation to an experienced leader at another location, who could then authorized her to check us in.We realize that the oversight was completely our fault, but ultimately an easy fix. I'm not sure the extent of training Marriott employees receive, or how they select their employees, but clearly their management needs to make some big improvements to what practices are currently in place.A little advice to The Marriott management team: Having staff that are well trained, able to offer solutions when ""life happens,"" and then have the empowerment to implement said solutions should be the standard of a world class hotel chain. It is not impossible to keep the interests of your guests aligned with those of your business. In fact, this should be at the heart and soul of any business in the hospitality industry. After our stay at your hotel, we immediately left for our European honeymoon. I wish we could share the countless unforgettable memories we experienced from employees in the hospitality industry during our travels.Upon hearing it was our honeymoon, British Airway Stewards upgraded us to 1st class and treated us like Royalty; they even gave us a bottle of champagne to say “congrats” while we were disembarking the aircraft.During a romantic dinner in Portugal, the chef personally came to out from the kitchen to congratulate us and present us with special appetizer, “complements of the chef.”Nearly everywhere we went, when we mentioned it was our honeymoon, employees of businesses that really cared, went above and beyond to make us feel special.The difference between the way they conduct their business to that of Courtyard Marriott was in pride shown in their work, and their commitment to making their customers feel welcome and special.These are the kinds of places we never forget and that we love bringing our friends and family to, so they can experience it for themselves.I’m sad to say our wedding night stay at Courtyard Marriott will never be forgotten, but unfortunately unforgettable for all the wrong reasons.",negative,real
898,Courtyard by Marriot South,Our air conditioner stopped working in the middle of the night and was informed it is motion activated for it to work which is ridiculous that it will turn off in the middle of the night while someone is sleeping.

899,Courtyard by Marriot South,"Within the first hour of checking in there was a false fire-alarm. This was unfortunate but not the hotels fault. However we noticed that there was a button in the room that said “ hold to silence fire alarm” we felt like this was unusual and made us think that false alarms could be a common issue for the hotel.The bathroom appeared nice at the start, however, the toilet stopped flushing, the toiletries ( shampoo and conditioner) were used and half empty, and there was a mysterious brown stain on the door.We decided to ignore all of this and watch something on the “complimentary” and “high-speed” wifi. After attempting to connect with the provided password an alert came up that said we had reached the maximum number of devices allowed and to contact the front desk for an authorization code. They provided a password for a different network which was so painfully slow we couldn’t even load a website. I called the front desk again and a woman answered. After explaining the situation she began to provide an authorization code, when I asked her to slow down and repeat the code she placed me on hold. A man then answered the line after a couple moments and asked how he could help. I then repeated my issue and asked for the authorization code, he stated that there was no other code, after I asked to speak to the woman again as she was providing me one he gave in and provided the code. He then began to give excuses as to why he lied and didn’t want to provide the other code.Other than the staff and the bathroom, the bed was nice and there were two large windows in the room.Really disappointed and will not be staying at a Marriott again.",negative,real

I decided to stay here after finding out it was only two weeks old and part of Hilton.My room (Bask) was beautiful and spacious, I also loved my breakfast from the Mexican restaurant located inside the hotel - Fonda Fora.Staff - Cassandra and Jeanette were helpful and friendly, especially Cameron. He was amazing and made me feel really taken care of as Hilton Honors Gold member. I’d definitely stay here again next time I am in town.",positive,real

Love the interface between the lobby and the Fonda Fora restaurant, creates a super cool atmosphere that leaves you torn between checking in, and grabbing a drink at the bar. Everything has that ‘new hotel’ smell, which is pretty cool and makes you feel like your putting the first KMs on a new car.

993,Hotel Arts Kensington,"This is a small boutique hotel that feels more like a B&B with some issues than a hotel that has service down to a science. The good news is that all of these issues are fixable, should the owners care to do so. We made the best of it. We stayed here during the Calgary Stampede. If we learned that the bathroom lighting, AC and service issues were addressed, we might stay here again.Pros- A tranquil repose from Stampede.- It was fun to explore a different neighborhood (Kensington) and Memorial Park along the Bow River.- The rooms are very spacious and nicely designed.- Very comfortable bed and pillows, if you like beds on the softer side like we do.- Open shelves in the closet were very helpful.- Coffee and tea service of your choice left at your door every morning. This was a very nice touch.- Delicious breakfast service and very friendly, helpful breakfast staff- No World Cup to show in the bar during the World Cup. The rooms had TSN, but not the bar. It's a shame they didn't spring for the package that month.Cons- Hotel overlooks a major thoroughfare with heavy traffic- While the rooms are lovely and well designed, the bathrooms are surprisingly lacking in basic hotel features: unusually low lighting and no grab bar in the shower with a very tall bathtub made getting in and out of the shower feel unsafe. We put our makeup on in the main room because we couldn't see well enough in the bathroom. We asked for a light and were told there was none to offer. There is also no shelf space of any kind in the bathroom itself so we had to keep our toiletries in the closet.- The AC system in the rooms cannot be turned off because it is centrally managed. This was confirmed by multiple front desk folks. If you don't like air blowing directly on you during the night, your sleep may be impacted.- The room was not thoroughly cleaned during the stay. Towels were changed but room surfaces were left visibly uncleaned. This was a big disappointment.- Front desk staff doubles as maintenance, housekeeping, room service, concierge, and everything in between. They all seem stretched beyond capacity. Having two people on staff rather than one seems like it would help. One man in particular was super grouchy with everyone and unhelpful to us throughout our stay. He clearly hates his job, which no one wants to deal with on vacation.",negative,real

I spoke to the new manager Colin who unfortunately would not allow me to use the certificate even though I have email confirmation from the previous manager. He was stern in saying their policy has always been without the physical certificate his hands were tied. Clearly that has not always been the policy as the previous manager had no issue allowing it.

995,Hotel Arts Kensington,"As you may know, I wrote a review for this hotel post renovations in August 2017 and felt compelled to write another as the service and hospitality has suffered a great deal and i hope to spare some of you a mediocre experience for a mid-high price.We checked in as usual and was told by Nathan that the restaurant was opened until 9pm. We decided that we had enough time for a nap and then dinner as we travel in from quite a distance. He also asked if we wanted coffee or tea, I requested English Breakfast, milk and sugar for 7am as we had an early appointment.We went down to the restaurant at 8:10 and it was closed, I thought perhaps I had heard incorrectly so I verified with Nathan and his response was ""Yeah I did, sorry about that but they dictate to me."" We ended up eating at Nicko's around the corner while Nathan (we could see through the window outside) continued to watch YouTube videos. When we returned he did not greet us. The next morning I received my tea, Earl Grey, no milk or sugar and a wake up call we didn't request.The lunch was alright but nothing like we have had in the past and not as flavourful. I would give some praise to our server, even though he looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there, if he had introduced himself.On check out I spoke to a gentleman who was kind enough to attempt to make some restitution for the unfortunate lapses and would praise him as well...if he had introduced himself or was wearing a name tag.

Really glad he didn't pay the additional price for a room with a river view as there is a major road and a car park between the hotel and the river.He had ordered a bottle of Prosecco for us and it was lovely as were the interesting chocolates. Sadly our flight was hours late so we did not enjoy it as much at 11:30 pm as we would have around 9:00.Room was lovely, big bathroom with separate shower, king sized bed and fire place. We were on the ground floor with a patio. We saw the patio area in the morning...would have been nicer IF the dead plants had been removed. No sound proofing either, we could hear people walking around upstairs and had a window looking out to the alley and got to enjoy all the garage trucks during the mornings.Coffee is delivered to the room each morning in a thermos, we asked for hot milk with the coffee but was told it couldn't be guaranteed. In the morning we found our coffee at the door on a tray...creamer in little containers but no sugar! Who delivers a coffee tray without sugar?? Well it turns out this hotel does UNLESS you specifically ask for it! Which I did do...and the sugar varied every day...sometimes it was sugar cubes others it was packets with white sugar and others packets with a variety of them.Some days we were given spoons to use and others plastic cocktail stirrers; nothing consistent.Had breakfast once in the restaurant, nice staff but took awhile for our meal...we were the only ones in there.Cleaning our room:some days the sheets were changed other days not, the duvet was pulled over the sheets!Used glasses left in the room, I took photos and sure enough they were in the same spots when we returned which means they weren't even touched...just cleaned around. finally put all the glasses (6 of them) in one area and they were removed on our last night!lamp on the desk had a layer of dust on it. I wrote CLEAN ME on it...it was never cleaned.Checking out this morning I told the receptionist about the glasses, spoons and cleaning of the room. Her response was very lax...'oh, sorry about that. Yeah we do usually provide spoons for the coffee but if the restaurant is extra busy we use something else.' WHAT??? really??? There are 19 rooms in the place and you don't have enough spoons???We paid over $1000 Canadian for our stay and it was not worth it.",negative,real
997,Hotel Arts Kensington,We booked here due to location. Our first stay our room was right over the kitchen and very noisy but thought we would give it another try.This iwas our second stay. Our room tub drained very slowly. We stood in 6 inches of water while we showered.The rooms are very clean other than these two concerns.The beds are very comfortable.Our major concern was we checked to see if we could bring guests back to the lounge to watch the hockey game. We were advised that it was not a problem. We all arrived and told the bar service would only do a last call. I felt we were totally unwelcome and so did our guests. I was rude to the manager which I totally regret. We all just felt unwelcome after such a great check in.We did enjoy lunch at the Oxbow.Sad to say that all our guests of which they were 12 would think twice about staying after the unwelcome feeling in the lounge that evening.,negative,real
998,Hotel Arts Kensington,"Don't be fooled by the relais and chateaux branding. This is not a good hotel. Small and poky with unattractive exterior. In house restaurant is reputed to be good, we found it ok but not amazing. All in all an ok stay if it were a cheap hotel which it is not.",negative,real
999,Hotel Arts Kensington,"I booked the river view suite back in July and stayed here for one night around mid September. I faced the following issues during my stay:1) Absolutely no river view you can just see the congested road;2) Requested for a upper floor room mentioning I was sensitive to noise months in advance and receive absolute no feedback on why I got the ground floor room, I mentioned my request and the hotel offered me a smaller room on the second floor (why would I accept such offer when I already paid for the larger room);3) In room toilet was not flushed and had tissue in ti upon check-in;4) The patio chair had spider web all over it so it was not possible to sit in it, although I had no intention of sitting on a patio chair that was on the ground floor and you can literally say your greeting to every pedestrian;5) So called 'river view' room faces the main road and it is very noisy; and6) Very little amenities and having no in-room safe was bothersome.The upside of the hotel was that the room was comforting and was located near the city center so I could walk to restaurants near by.I booked this hotel because it received an excellence award from Tripadvisor but have no idea why it received such award.",negative,real
1000,Hotel Arts Kensington,"They claim to be a 4.5 stars , but they have meiocre service. They don't serve room service after 9:00 pm, and even before the just serve what they have in their ""gastronomic restaurant"" , so i order a sandwich or a soup, or even a piece of cheese and a piece of bread and they could not deliver. Very snop service for the a la carte menu, takes so much time and so little options. Bad service at the front desk, they don't help with the luggage, very bad location ,in front of a big avenue with almost nothing close! No gym, spa etc!Room is ok, but the window makes wind and cars noisy and has no mini bar. Charge lots of money for what they delivered! We always believe thant Relaix &chateau hotel must be good but unfourtunately this is not the case! Fully Disappointed!",negative,real
